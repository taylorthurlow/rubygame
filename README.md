## some stupid ruby game

This is a basic 2D game framework built with Ruby. It is based on [this amazing book](https://leanpub.com/developing-games-with-ruby/read), modified to read maps exported from [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/).

There are a bunch of dependencies which I should list here, but haven't gotten around to it. If you really want to try it, do a `bundle install` and fix all of the compilation errors. Most of them should be fixed by following the instructions on [Gosu's website](https://www.libgosu.org/).
